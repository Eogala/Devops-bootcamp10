# Prerequisites for Deploying the Prometheus Stack using Docker Compose

- **AWS Account with a Key Pair:** Ensure you have an AWS account and have created a key pair for accessing EC2 instances.
- **AWS CLI Configured:** Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine with your AWS account credentials.
- **Terraform Installed:** Make sure Terraform is installed on your local machine for provisioning infrastructure.


## Prometheus Stack Architecture & Workflow

![alt text](images/diagram.png)


In our setup, we will be using the following components.
 

1. **Prometheus:** Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system designed to collect metrics from various sources, such as application and system performance data, and store them in a time-series database. It scrapes metrics from exporters, processes them, and provides this data to visualization tools like Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting.

2. **Alert Manager:** Alert Manager is a component of Prometheus that handles alerts based on predefined rules. It routes alerts to various notification channels, such as email, Slack, or other messaging platforms, and provides a centralized dashboard for managing and viewing alert statuses, helping teams quickly respond to potential issues.

3. **Node Exporter:** Node Exporter is an agent for Prometheus that collects hardware and OS-level metrics from Linux systems, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O. These metrics are exposed at the /metrics endpoint, allowing Prometheus to scrape and monitor server performance effectively.

4. **Grafana:** Grafana is a powerful data visualization and monitoring tool that integrates with Prometheus to create interactive and customizable dashboards. It supports various data sources and provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing complex data sets, helping teams analyze and understand system performance and trends.

5. **Terraform:** Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows developers to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. It supports multiple cloud providers and helps automate the creation, updating, and versioning of infrastructure resources, making infrastructure management efficient and repeatable.

6. **Docker:** Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, which are lightweight and portable units that package an application and its dependencies. Docker ensures consistency across different environments, simplifies the deployment process, and isolates applications, making it easier to manage and scale.

7. **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file. It allows users to configure application services, networks, and volumes, making it easy to deploy and manage multi-container environments by handling service dependencies and orchestration.
# Spin up an Ubuntu 24.04 EC2 instance we shall be using it for this project

Connect your instance via ssh


Clone the project repository to your instance
```
git clone https://github.com/TobiOlajumoke/prometheus-observability-stack
```
The project code is present in the prometheus-observability-stack folder. cd into the folder.
```
cd prometheus-observability-stack
```
Note: Use visual studio code or relevant IDE to understand the code structure better.

Here is the project structure and config files:
```

├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── alertmanager
│   └── alertmanager.yml
├── docker-compose.yml
├── prometheus
│   ├── alertrules.yml
│   ├── prometheus.yml
│   └── targets.json
└── terraform-aws
    ├── README.md
    ├── modules
    │   ├── ec2
    │   │   ├── main.tf
    │   │   ├── outputs.tf
    │   │   ├── user-data.sh
    │   │   └── variables.tf
    │   └── security-group
    │       ├── main.tf
    │       ├── outputs.tf
    │       └── variables.tf
    ├── prometheus-stack
    │   ├── main.tf
    │   ├── outputs.tf
    │   └── variables.tf
    └── vars
        └── ec2.tfvars
```
Let’s understand the project files.

The alertmanager folder contains the alertmanager.yml file which is the configuration file. If you have details of the email, slack, etc. we can update accordingly.

The prometheus folder contains alertrules.yml which is responsible for the alerts to be triggered from the prometheus to the alert manager. The prometheus.yml config is also mapped to the alert manager endpoint to fetch, Service discovery is used with the help of a file `file_sd_configs` to scrape the metrics using the targets.json file.

terraform-aws directory allows you to manage and isolate resources effectively. modules contain the reusable terraform code. These contain the Terraform configuration files (main.tf, outputs.tf, variables.tf) for the respective modules.

The ec2 module also includes user-data.sh script to bootstrap the EC2 instance with Docker and Docker Compose. The security group module will create all the inbound & outbound rules required.

Prometheus-stack Contains the configuration file main.tf required for running the terraform. Vars contains an ec2.tfvars file which contains variable values specific to all the files for the terraform project.

The Makefile is used update the provisioned AWS EC2’s public IP address within the configuration files of prometheus.yml and targets.json located in the prometheus directory.

The docker-compose.yml file incorporates various services Prometheus, Grafana, Node exporter & Alert Manager. These services are mapped with a network named ‘monitor‘ and have an ‘always‘ restart flag as well.


## To do this project you need to have the following.

1. A Valid AWS account with full permissions to create and manage AWS VPC service.
2. Setup terraform on an ec2 instance, ensure you have a valid IAM role attached to the instance with VPC provisioning permissions.


We are going to spin up an ec2 instance and attach the following IAM roles to it:

- AmazonVPCFullAccess
- AmazonEC2FullAccess
