# Prerequisites for Deploying the Prometheus Stack using Docker Compose

- **AWS Account with a Key Pair:** Ensure you have an AWS account and have created a key pair for accessing EC2 instances.
- **AWS CLI Configured:** Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine with your AWS account credentials.
- **Terraform Installed:** Make sure Terraform is installed on your local machine for provisioning infrastructure.


## Prometheus Stack Architecture & Workflow

In our setup, we will be using the following components.
 

1. **Prometheus:** Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system designed to collect metrics from various sources, such as application and system performance data, and store them in a time-series database. It scrapes metrics from exporters, processes them, and provides this data to visualization tools like Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting.

2. **Alert Manager:** Alert Manager is a component of Prometheus that handles alerts based on predefined rules. It routes alerts to various notification channels, such as email, Slack, or other messaging platforms, and provides a centralized dashboard for managing and viewing alert statuses, helping teams quickly respond to potential issues.

3. **Node Exporter:** Node Exporter is an agent for Prometheus that collects hardware and OS-level metrics from Linux systems, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O. These metrics are exposed at the /metrics endpoint, allowing Prometheus to scrape and monitor server performance effectively.

4. **Grafana:** Grafana is a powerful data visualization and monitoring tool that integrates with Prometheus to create interactive and customizable dashboards. It supports various data sources and provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing complex data sets, helping teams analyze and understand system performance and trends.

5. **Terraform:** Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows developers to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. It supports multiple cloud providers and helps automate the creation, updating, and versioning of infrastructure resources, making infrastructure management efficient and repeatable.

6. **Docker:** Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, which are lightweight and portable units that package an application and its dependencies. Docker ensures consistency across different environments, simplifies the deployment process, and isolates applications, making it easier to manage and scale.

7. **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file. It allows users to configure application services, networks, and volumes, making it easy to deploy and manage multi-container environments by handling service dependencies and orchestration.
